The sky was clouded grey, rain drops fell upon his face
Seven years he threw away, when he broke his dear love's heart
And it shouldn't end this scurry across the ground
He caught her eye, at the next light
The tears were far too strong to fight
She said "what are you doing here?"
This moment I have long since feared
No, I'm not the girl you left behind
She's been gone for quite some time"
And you could see it in her eyes,
She had run out of tears to cry
And as she turned and walked away,
Seven years had gone to waste.
