A man walks in through the door
Takes a look as he passes through the wall
On & on electrically & flowing
Backward stance head hung low
Don't you raise your head into the golden flow
Do you dare, do you dare to follow

City Lights will burn your eyes
City Lights will light the skies
City Lights can terrorize

Gazing on in a dream
--------try to tell you what they mean
-------------------
--------in the shadows
Still I wonder what could be the matter
Is it real or fantasy ---------

City Lights will burn your eyes
City Lights will light the skies
City Lights can terrorize

City Lights will guard the night
Like an angel with a flaming sword
A warning to the wild & weak
That even the best things can be so hard

There again the scene unfolds
----------light it seems so very cold
-------------------------
-------light of day
All this world will have gently slipped away
Disappearing in the sunlight

City Lights will burn your eyes
City Lights will light the skies
City Lights can terrorize

City Lights will guard the night
Like an angel with a flaming sword
A warning to the wild & weak
That even the best things can be so hard
