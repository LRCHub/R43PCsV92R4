Out in the open
The road stretches ahead of me
A steel cage in my rearview
I'm driving at full speed
No one to run to
No one to leave behind
The city that never sleeps
But she keeps me up at night

I'm already on my way
A few right turns and I'll be at her place
I'm already on my way
Neon colours light up the sky
Driving under city lights

Out in the open
The road stretches ahead of me
A steel cage in my rearview
I'm driving at full speed
No one to run to
No one to leave behind
Watching strangers in the night
Under the blur of city lights

Your getaway car
Escape through the city
Blend into a crowd
Nobody knows who we are

I'm already on my way
A few right turns and I'll be at her place
I'm already on my way
Neon colours light up the sky
Driving under city lights

Driving in the night
Under city lights
Neon colours light up the sky
'Cause I'm driving under
Under city lights

I'm already on my way
A few right turns and I'll be at her place
I'm already on my way
Neon colours light up the sky
Driving under city lights
